This Python program, called "Number Guesser," is a simple interactive game where the computer tries<br />
to guess a number selected by the user between 1 and 100. The computer starts by making a random guess,<br />
and the user provides feedback on whether the guess is "Higher" or "Lower" than their chosen number.<br />
Based on the feedback, the computer adjusts its range of possible guesses and continues until it<br />
correctly identifies the user's number. The program tracks and displays the number of guesses taken<br />
to find the correct answer.<br />
