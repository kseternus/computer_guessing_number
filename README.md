This Python program, called "Number Guesser," is a simple interactive game where the computer tries to guess a number<br />
selected by the user between 1 and 100. The computer starts by making a random guess, and the user provides<br />
feedback on whether the guess is "Higher" or "Lower" than their chosen number. Based on the feedback, the computer<br />
adjusts its range of possible guesses and continues until it correctly identifies the user's number. The program tracks<br />
and displays the number of guesses taken to find the correct answer.<br />
